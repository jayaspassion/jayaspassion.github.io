    "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jayasoorya Jithendra, a Software Engineer with over 3 years of experience, currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at SUNY Buffalo. I specialize in Frontend and Full Stack Development and also have solid academic and project experience in Data Science and Machine Learning. I've contributed to impactful products at Dassault SystÃ¨mes, Siemens, and Synoriq, and I build scalable, user-friendly applications using technologies like React.js, Vue.js, Node.js, and MongoDB. I'm actively seeking Software Development or Data Science Internship opportunities across the U.S. to apply and grow my skills in real-world, innovative projects.",
    "philosophy": "Iâ€™m a passionate, fast-learning technologist with a strong foundation in both frontend engineering and data-driven development. I thrive in agile, collaborative environments and enjoy solving problems through clean, maintainable code. With a track record of technical leadership, mentoring, and impactful contributions across web development and ML projects, I bring a balanced mix of product thinking and engineering depth. I believe in continuous learning, thoughtful design, and delivering value through scalable solutions.",
    "preference": "I'm currently looking for Software Development, Frontend, Full Stack, or Data Science / Machine Learning Internship roles in the U.S. I am not considering relocation back to India and am open to remote or in-person roles anywhere in the U.S. Iâ€™m especially excited about working with modern tech stacks involving React, Node.js, Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and cloud platforms like AWS or Azure, and contributing to data-driven products and scalable platforms.",
